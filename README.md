</p>

## ⚡ Just one line.

```bash
onecomp <generative AI>
```

**That's all you need.** OneComp detects your GPU VRAM, picks the best bit-width per layer, quantizes with error propagation, evaluates, and saves — fully automatic.

```bash
# Example
onecomp meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf
```

Or from Python:

```python
from onecomp import Runner

Runner.auto_run(model_id="meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf")
```

## 📖 Documentation

Full documentation is available at **[https://FujitsuResearch.github.io/OneCompression/](https://FujitsuResearch.github.io/OneCompression/)**.

## 📦 Features

- **Quantization Error Propagation (QEP)**: A post-training quantization method that corrects quantization errors by propagating them to subsequent layers, improving the accuracy of quantized LLMs. See [Arai & Ichikawa, NeurIPS 2025](https://openreview.net/forum?id=a3l3K9khbL) for details. The original reference implementation is available at [FujitsuResearch/qep](https://github.com/FujitsuResearch/qep).
- **Layer-Projected Coordinate Descent (LPCD)**: A unified Post Training Quantization (PTQ) framework that extends layer-wise quantization to arbitrary submodules by optimising relaxed objectives and projecting the solutions with layer-wise quantizers. See [Ichikawa et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01546) for details.
- **vLLM Plugin Integration**: Serve OneComp-quantized models with [vLLM](https://docs.vllm.ai/) via built-in plugins for DBF and Mixed-GPTQ quantization methods. Pair with [Open WebUI](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui) for a ChatGPT-like chat experience on your local machine.
- **AutoBit**: Mixed-precision quantization with ILP-based bitwidth assignment. Automatically estimates the target bitwidth from available VRAM and assigns per-layer bitwidths to minimize quantization error under the memory budget.
- **JointQ**: Joint quantization method that optimizes weight assignments and scale parameters simultaneously for improved quantization accuracy. Supports group-wise quantization (e.g., 4-bit, groupsize=128).
- **Block-wise PTQ**: Post-quantization block-wise distillation that minimises intermediate-representation MSE against an FP16 teacher model at Transformer-block granularity. Includes Phase 1 (greedy per-block optimisation) and Phase 2 CBQ (cross-block sliding-window optimisation). Supports GPTQ, DBF, and OneBit quantizers.
- **LoRA SFT Post-Process**: Fine-tune quantized models with LoRA adapters for accuracy recovery or domain-specific knowledge injection. Supports SFT loss, teacher distillation, and intermediate block alignment.
- **Rotation Preprocessing**: SpinQuant/OstQuant-based rotation preprocessing that reduces quantization error by learning optimal rotation matrices before quantization. Rotation/scaling matrices are absorbed into model weights, with online Hadamard hooks automatically registered at load time. Supports Llama and Qwen3 architectures.
- **Web Dashboard (HPC)**: A browser-based dashboard for launching quantization jobs, deploying models, and validating chat-based inference in HPC environments. See [dashboard/README.md](dashboard/README.md) for details.
- (TBD)

## 🔧 Installation

### for users (pip)

#### 1. Install PyTorch

Please install the appropriate version of PyTorch.

#### ✅ CPU-only
```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
```

#### ✅ CUDA-enabled

Choose the appropriate CUDA version for your system:

| CUDA Version | Installation Command |
|--------------|------------------------|
| CUDA 11.8    | `pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118` |
| CUDA 12.1    | `pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121` |
| CUDA 12.4    | `pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124` |
| CUDA 12.6    | `pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu126` |
| CUDA 12.8    | `pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128` |
| CUDA 13.0    | `pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu130` |

Check your CUDA version:
```bash
nvcc --version
```

or
```bash
nvidia-smi
```

Verify PyTorch GPU support:
```python
import torch
print(torch.cuda.is_available())
```

#### ✅ macOS (MPS)

On macOS, install PyTorch from PyPI (default wheels include MPS support). You do **not** need the CUDA index URLs above.

```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
```

Verify MPS:
```python
import torch
print(torch.backends.mps.is_available())
```

Then install OneComp from PyPI (see step 2 below). GPTQ quantization and Hugging Face `generate()` inference on MPS are supported; vLLM serving requires Linux with an NVIDIA GPU. An editable install from a git clone is **not** required for MPS use — see [for developers (pip)](#for-developers-pip) only if you are contributing to OneComp.

> **MPS device placement (GPTQ vs QEP)**  
> With `device="mps"`, calibration and model forward passes can run on the GPU. The bottleneck is usually not missing Cholesky ops on MPS (recent PyTorch builds implement them); the implementation splits work as follows:
>
> - GPTQ (`run_gptq`): Hessian and weights are moved to CPU for the full column-wise loop (including inverse-Hessian Cholesky). If that loop stayed on MPS, `quantize()` would call `maxq.item()` once per column; each call triggers **per-column host sync** (wait for pending MPS ops, then read one scalar—not a full Hessian/weight copy every column)—often several times slower than CPU on Apple Silicon (e.g. ~4× in internal benchmarks with PyTorch 2.12). Keeping GPTQ on CPU avoids that overhead. With `mse=True`, `find_params` also calls `quantize()` in a grid loop and benefits from the same CPU placement.
> - QEP weight correction (`adjust_weight`, when QEP correction runs—typically `qep=True` with error propagation enabled): Per-layer work stays on MPS (e.g. `weight @ delta_hatX`, diagonal damping). Only the Cholesky solve uses CPU via `_safe_cholesky_and_solve` (one solve per layer, not per column); moving all of QEP to CPU does not materially improve speed. The subsequent GPTQ step still uses the CPU path above.
>
> DBF-based AutoBit fallback and multi-GPU quantization are not supported on MPS.

#### 2. Install `onecomp`

Once PyTorch is installed, you can install `onecomp`:

```bash
pip install onecomp
```

To enable multi-GPU training features (DeepSpeed), install with the `distributed` extra:

```bash
pip install "onecomp[distributed]"
```

### for developers (uv : recommended)

#### Install `uv`

[`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) is a fast Python package and project manager written in Rust.
It offers a drop-in replacement for pip and pip-tools while also managing virtual environments and Python installations.
With its Rust-based dependency resolver and the `uv.lock` lockfile, uv provides deterministic and reproducible environments across development machines and CI pipelines.

```bash
# install uv (for macOS or Linux)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

git clone https://github.com/FujitsuResearch/OneCompression.git
cd OneCompression
```

The `uv sync` command creates a Python virtual environment and installs all dependent libraries.

#### Linux (CUDA quantization / vLLM)

```bash
uv sync --extra cu128 --extra dev --extra visualize
```

The `--extra cu128` option installs the CUDA-enabled version of PyTorch (along with `torchvision` from the same CUDA index).
Replace `cu128` with the appropriate variant for your environment: `cpu`, `cu118`, `cu121`, `cu124`, `cu126`, `cu128`, or `cu130`.
PyTorch will be automatically downloaded by `uv`, so you do not need to install it beforehand.

#### macOS (development / MPS inference)

```bash
uv sync --extra mps --extra dev --extra visualize
```

On macOS, use `--extra mps` only. CUDA extras (`cu118`–`cu130`), `--extra cpu` (Linux-only), and `--extra vllm` are not supported on macOS.
After `uv sync`, you can run GPTQ quantization and Hugging Face `generate()` inference on MPS; vLLM serving still requires Linux with an NVIDIA GPU.
See the **MPS device placement (GPTQ vs QEP)** note under [macOS (MPS)](#macos-mps) above for why GPTQ runs on CPU while QEP correction uses MPS.

Adding `--extra dev` installs development tools (black, pre-commit, pytest, pylint).
Adding `--extra visualize` installs matplotlib for visualization features.
Adding `--extra distributed` installs DeepSpeed for multi-GPU training.
Adding `--extra hydra` installs `hydra-core` for the example scripts and `model_validation/` runners that use Hydra-based configuration.

To use vLLM for serving quantized models on Linux, add `--extra vllm` together with `--extra cu130`:

```bash
uv sync --extra cu130 --extra dev --extra visualize --extra vllm
```

> **Note:** `--extra vllm` is only compatible with `--extra cu130`. Recent vLLM releases require `torch>=2.10`, whose wheels are only published for the `cu130` index. Combining `--extra vllm` with `cpu` / `mps` / `cu118` / `cu121` / `cu124` / `cu126` / `cu128` is rejected by `uv` at lock time.

> **Note:** `--extra vllm` may take a long time on the first run if a pre-built `xformers` wheel is not available for your Python/CUDA combination (e.g. Python 3.13). Using Python 3.12 typically avoids this.

#### Running commands (uv environment)

In the environment created by `uv sync`, you can run commands in two ways:

##### Option 1: Use `uv run` (no activation needed)

```bash
uv run pytest tests/ -v
uv run python example/example_gptq.py
uv run black --check onecomp/
```

##### Option 2: Activate the virtual environment (traditional approach)

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
pytest tests/ -v
python example/example_gptq.py
black --check onecomp/
```

### for developers (pip)

> **Note:** The editable install below is for developing OneComp from a local clone. **macOS users who only want MPS inference or quantization should use the [for users (pip)](#for-users-pip) flow** (`pip install torch` then `pip install onecomp` from PyPI); `pip install -e` is not needed for MPS.

```bash
git clone <git repository URL>
cd OneCompression

# First, install PyTorch with CUDA support for your environment
pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128
# Then install onecomp with development dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Replace `cu128` with the appropriate variant for your environment: `cpu`, `cu118`, `cu121`, `cu124`, `cu126`, `cu128`, or `cu130`.

#### Pre-commit

After installing development dependencies (`--extra dev` with uv, or `pip install -e ".[dev]"` with pip), register the Git hooks once:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

On every `git commit`, the following checks run automatically:

| Hook | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **black** | Code formatting (line length 99) |
| **isort** | Import sorting |
| **no-japanese** | Forbid Japanese characters in text files (`.md` and `.gitignore` are excluded) |
| **copyright-header** | Verify the Fujitsu copyright header in Python files |
| **no-email-address** | Forbid email addresses in Python files |

Common commands:

```bash
# Run hooks on staged files only
pre-commit run

# Run hooks on all files (useful after first install or config changes)
pre-commit run --all-files

# Run a specific hook
pre-commit run black --all-files

# With uv (no activation needed)
uv run pre-commit run --all-files
```


### Building Documentation Locally

`--extra docs` alone is sufficient (no PyTorch `mps` / `cu*` extra required):

```bash
uv sync --extra docs
uv run mkdocs serve
```

Then open [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000) in your browser.

## 🔌 vLLM Inference

OneComp-quantized models can be served with [vLLM](https://docs.vllm.ai/): GPTQ, JointQ, and RTN models use vLLM's built-in GPTQ plugin, while DBF and Mixed-GPTQ models are served via OneComp's own plugins.
Combined with [Open WebUI](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui), you can chat with your quantized model through a ChatGPT-like browser interface — entirely on your local machine.

```bash
# uv users (vLLM requires cu130; see Installation for details)
uv sync --extra cu130 --extra vllm

# pip users
pip install vllm
```

See the [vLLM Inference guide](https://FujitsuResearch.github.io/OneCompression/user-guide/vllm-inference/) for details, including Open WebUI setup instructions.
