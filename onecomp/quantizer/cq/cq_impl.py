"""CQ (Clustering Quantization) quantization module

This module provides CQ quantization functionality for neural network weights.
CQ is a 2-value clustering quantization method that splits weights into two clusters
for quantization.

Functions:
    run_cq(layer, each_row): Execute CQ quantization on a layer.

    Performs 2-value clustering quantization using CQ (Clustering Quantization).
