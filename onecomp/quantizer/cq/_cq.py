@dataclass
class CQ(Quantizer):
    """CQ (Clustering Quantization) quantizer.

    CQ is a 2-value clustering quantization method that splits weights into two clusters
    for quantization. It compresses weights by computing mean values for each cluster
    and binarizing based on thresholds.

    Quantization method:
    - Sorts weights and finds the split point that minimizes SSE (Sum of Squared Errors)
    - Uses the split point as a threshold to classify weights into two
      clusters (left_mean, right_mean)
    - quantized_weight takes values {0, 1}, where 0 corresponds to left_mean and 1 to right_mean

    CQ does not require calibration data or Hessian matrix.
    each_row=True generally provides higher accuracy but increases parameter count.

    Attributes:
        flag_calibration (bool): Whether to use calibration data (False for CQ).
        flag_hessian (bool): Whether to use Hessian matrix (False for CQ).
        each_row (bool): Whether to quantize row-wise. If True, computes independent
            threshold and cluster means for each row. If False, processes entire weight
            as a single vector to compute global threshold and cluster means. Default is True.

    Methods:
        quantize_layer(module, input, hessian): Quantize a layer using CQ.
